/**
 * Every reference in Rust has lifetime, which is the scope for which that reference is valid
 * Most of the time lifetimes are implicit and inferred, just like most of the time , types are inferred
 * We must annotate lifetimes when the lifetimes of references could be related in a few different ways
 * Rust requires ussto annotate the relationships using generic lifetime parameter to ensure the actual references used at runtime will definitely be valid
 * 
 * Lifetime annotations dont change how long any of the references live.   
 * Lifetime annotations describe the relationships of the lifetimes of multiple references to each other without affecting the lifetimes
 * One lifetime annotation by itself doesn't have much meaning, because the annotations are meant to tell Rust how generic lifetime parameters of multiple references relate to each other
 * The lifetimes parameters must start with an apostrophe( ' )

// Remember, when we specify the lifetime parameters in this function signature, weâ€™re not changing the lifetimes of any values passed in or returned
// Rather, weâ€™re specifying that the borrow checker should reject any values that donâ€™t adhere to these constraints
// Note that the longest function doesnâ€™t need to know exactly how long x and y will live, only that some scope can be substituted for 'a that will satisfy this signature
// When annotating lifetimes in functions, the annotations go in the function signature, not in the function body. Rust can analyze the code within the function without any help

/**
 * When returning a reference from a function, the lifetime parameter for the return type needs to match the lifetime parameter

// ðŸ’¡ There are rules that Rust can implicitly infer lifetime parameter for programmers
//* Lifetimes on function or method parameters are called ~input lifetime, and lifetimeson return values are called output lifetimes
/**
 * There are 3 rule that compiler use to figure out what lifetimes references have when there aren't explicit annotations. 
 * The first rule applies to input lifetimes and the second and third rules apply to output lifetimes If the compiler gets to 
 * the end of the three rules and there are still references for which it canâ€™t figure out lifetimes, the compiler will stop 
 * with an error. These rules apply to fn definitions as well as impl blocks.
 */

/**
 * 1st rule: each parameter that is a reference gets its own lifetime parameter. In other words, 
 * a function with one parameter gets one lifetime parameter: fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32); a function 
 * with two parameters gets two separate lifetime parameters: fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32); and so on
 */

/**
 * 2nd rule: if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters: fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32
 */

/**
 * 3rd rule: if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is &self or &mut self because this is a method, 
 * the lifetime of self is assigned to all output lifetime parameters
