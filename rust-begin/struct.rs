// Using Tuple Structs without ðŸ‘‰Named Fields to Create Different Types
// It looks like a Tuple, define by using struct statment but don't have struct fields

struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);

// ðŸ’¡ Note that the ðŸ‘‰black and ðŸ‘‰origin values are different types, because they're instances of different structs.
// ðŸ’¡ A function that takes a parameter of type ðŸ‘‰Color cannot take a ðŸ‘‰Point as an argument even though they are oth made up of 3 i32 values.  
// ðŸ’¡ Tuple struct behave like tuples: you can destruction them, you can use a . followed by the index to access an individual value


// Unit-Like Structs Without Any Fields
// You can also define structs that donâ€™t have any fields! These are called unit-like structs because they behave similarly to (), the unit type. 
// Unit-like structs can be useful in situations in which you need to implement a trait on some type 
// but donâ€™t have any data that you want to store in the type itself.




// Example for Implementation
//Using Struct to Calculating Area of a Rectangle
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 };

/**
 * Weâ€™ve chosen &self here because we donâ€™t want to take ownership, and we just want to read the data in the struct, not write to it.

 * Having a method that takes ownership of the instance by using just self as the first parameter is rare;
