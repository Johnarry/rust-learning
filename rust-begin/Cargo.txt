Create A New Project:                                               cargo new
Build The Project:                                                  cargo build
Run The Project:                                                    cargo run
Update Project Dependencies:                                        cargo update
Run Test:                                                           cargo test 
Generate The Project docs via rust doc:                             cargo doc
Analyze the project to see it has any errors, without building it:  cargo check


<--/    Publish the Project as a crate    /-->
Log in to crate.io:                                 cargo login
Make the local crate uploadedable to crate.io:      cargo package
Upload the crate to crates.io:                      cargo publish


‚≠ê A crate is a package which can be shared via cargo
A crate can produce an executable or a library. In other words, it can be a binary crate or a library crate.
    cargo new <crate_name> --bin  OR  cargo new <crate_name>
    cargo new <crate_name> --lib


üí° When we build a binary crate via ~ cargo build or cargo run, the executable file will be stored in target/debug/ folder.
But when build it via ~ cargo build --release for a release it will be stored in target/release/ folder.
